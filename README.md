# NGUIndustries-Beacon-Effect-Map

This is a map that will show which tiles are effected by how many beacons. Within the folders you will find two .png files and a .xfc file. The Beacons.png shows every effected tile and the Beacons Only.png shows nothing but the beacons. The .xcf is a GIMP file that will allow you to toggle the visibility of each layer (See below). This may make it easier to find specific tiles.

Currently Tutorial Island, Flesh World, and Planet Tronne are complete.
