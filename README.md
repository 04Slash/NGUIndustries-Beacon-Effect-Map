# NGUIndustries-Beacon-Effect-Map

This is a map that will show which tiles are effected by how many beacons. Within the Flesh World folder you will find a .png and .xfc file. The PNG file is a picture of everything enabled and the .xcf is a GIMP file that will allow you to toggle the visibility of each layer (See below). This may make it easier to find specific tiles.

Currently Tutorial Island and Flesh World are complete.
